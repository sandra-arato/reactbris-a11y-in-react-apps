# An Amazing App

This aims to be the simplest webapp ever to showcase some accessibility tools that you can implement in _your_ React application. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and presented at React Bris in November (2019).

## Toolbox

The following packages have been added or considered:

```
npx create-react-app amazing-app
yarn add react-axe --dev
yarn add @reach/router
yarn add @storybook/addon-a11y --dev
// yarn add eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y --dev
// yarn add jest-axe --dev
```

You can run the app with `yarn start`, and from Step 5 you also have access to `yarn storybook`

### Accessibility Patterns

Accessibility patterns on the web are supposed to help you with complex html structures and widgets so that you don't have to start from scratch.

### Testing and CI/CD in Accessibility

Consider adding an a11y linter to your project, and possibly unit tests for critical places so that you're covered with some sweet automated tests.
